I have started working with Angular 2 recently, and I am finding the transition pretty difficult.  With the transition to Typescript, the one-way data binding, the component structure, and the use of observables, it’s clear that I have quite a bit to bring myself up to speed on to make the switch.  I’ll be dedicating a sizable series leading up to Angular 2, and I’ll start with an in-depth look at changes in Angular 1.5.
